# Set up fatigue management using typology rules

Fatigue management controls frequency and quantity of messaging to avoid over-solicitation of recipients and is often applied using a typology rule.

Typology rules allow marketers to standardize business practices across all deliveries more efficiently to control campaign messaging to customers. Typology rules eliminate the need to apply exclusions or commonly used rules to each individual campaign. Recipients that match criteria within a *typology rule* are excluded from the delivery during the analysis phase.

Usually a set of typology rules is grouped within a *typology* in order to easily apply multiple filtering rules to a delivery at once. The grouping into typologies eliminates extra steps when creating multiple campaigns and workflows and helps ensure that the right population is targeted at the right time.
