## Prerequisites

Before you can begin, you must have the following:

1) **Android™ Mobile application**

    This tutorial does not cover the detailed steps required to set up the mobile application. You must have an **[!DNL Android™] mobile application with the [!DNL Campaign SDK] integrated**.

    You can find a detailed description of the required steps in the product documentation:

2) **[!DNL Mobile App channel] package installed**

## Tutorial Overview

The objective is to send a personalized promotional [!DNL push] notification to the subscribers of the [!DNL Neotrip] [!DNL Android™] mobile app. The [!DNL Neotrip] app is configured with the [!DNL Campaign SDK] and  the [!DNL Mobile App channel] is activated on the [!DNL Campaign] instance.

The following configuration steps are required:

### Step 1: Extend the app subscription schema to personalize [!DNL push] notifications

To be able to personalize the [!DNL push] notification, you must first [extend the app subscription schema](/help/tutorial-get-started-with-push-notifications-for-android/extend-the-app-subscription-schema.md). THis allows the system to store the personalization values that are received from the app when the user subscribes to the service.

### Step 2: Configure the Android™ service and create the mobile application in Campaign

Next, [the Android™ service must be configures and the mobile application created in Campaign](/help/tutorial-get-started-with-push-notifications-for-android/configure-an-android-service-in-campaign.md). In this step, the [!DNL Neotrip] app is defined as the target for the push notification.

### Step 3: Configure and send the push notification

Now the push notification is ready to be [configured and sent](/help/tutorial-get-started-with-push-notifications-for-android/configure-and-send-push-notifications.md).
