# Create a workflow

Adobe Campaign includes a workflow module that empowers you to orchestrate the full range of processes and tasks across the different modules of the application server. This comprehensive graphical environment lets you design processes including segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, human participation, and so on. The workflow engine executes and tracks these processes.

Workflows occur within various contexts and stages of the campaign management process.

This video explains how to create a workflow in Adobe Campaign.
